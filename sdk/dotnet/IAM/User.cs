    /// <summary>
    /// The `unifi.iam.User` resource manages network clients in the UniFi controller, which are identified by their unique MAC addresses.
    /// 
    /// This resource allows you to manage:
    ///   * Fixed IP assignments
    ///   * User groups and network access
    ///   * Network blocking and restrictions
    ///   * Local DNS records
    /// 
    /// Important Notes:
    ///   * Users are automatically created in the controller when devices connect to the network
    ///   * By default, this resource can take over management of existing users (controlled by `AllowExisting`)
    ///   * Users can be 'forgotten' on destroy (controlled by `SkipForgetOnDestroy`)
    /// 
    /// This resource is particularly useful for:
    ///   * Managing static IP assignments
    ///   * Implementing access control
    ///   * Setting up local DNS records
    ///   * Organizing devices into user groups
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Unifi = Pulumiverse.Unifi;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     var test = new Unifi.IAM.User("test", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Mac = "01:23:45:67:89:AB",
    ///         Name = "some client",
    ///         Note = "my note",
    ///         FixedIp = "10.0.0.50",
    ///         NetworkId = myVlan.Id,
    ///     });
