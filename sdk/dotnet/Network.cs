    /// The `unifi.Network` resource manages networks in your UniFi environment, including WAN, LAN, and VLAN networks. This resource enables you to:
    /// 
    /// * Create and manage different types of networks (corporate, guest, WAN, VLAN-only)
    /// * Configure network addressing and DHCP settings
    /// * Set up IPv6 networking features
    /// * Manage DHCP relay and DNS settings
    /// * Configure network groups and VLANs
    /// 
    /// Common use cases include:
    /// * Setting up corporate and guest networks with different security policies
    /// * Configuring WAN connectivity with various authentication methods
    /// * Creating VLANs for network segmentation
    /// * Managing DHCP and DNS services for network clients
