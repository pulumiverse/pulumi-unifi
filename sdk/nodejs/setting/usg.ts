/**
 * The `unifi.setting.USG` resource manages advanced settings for UniFi Security Gateways (USG) and UniFi Dream Machines (UDM/UDM-Pro).
 *
 * This resource allows you to configure gateway-specific features including:
 *   * Multicast DNS (mDNS) for cross-VLAN service discovery
 *   * DHCP relay for forwarding DHCP requests to external servers
 *   * Geo IP filtering for country-based traffic control
 *   * UPNP/NAT-PMP for automatic port forwarding
 *   * Protocol helpers for FTP, GRE, H323, PPTP, SIP, and TFTP
 *   * TCP/UDP timeout settings for connection tracking
 *   * Security features like SYN cookies and ICMP redirect controls
 *   * MSS clamping for optimizing MTU issues
 *
 * Note: Some settings may not be available on all controller versions. For example, multicastDnsEnabled is not supported on UniFi OS v7+. Changes to certain attributes may not be reflected in the plan unless explicitly modified in the configuration.
