/**
 * The `unifi.iam.User` resource manages network clients in the UniFi controller, which are identified by their unique MAC addresses.
 *
 * This resource allows you to manage:
 *   * Fixed IP assignments
 *   * User groups and network access
 *   * Network blocking and restrictions
 *   * Local DNS records
 *
 * Important Notes:
 *   * Users are automatically created in the controller when devices connect to the network
 *   * By default, this resource can take over management of existing users (controlled by `allowExisting`)
 *   * Users can be 'forgotten' on destroy (controlled by `skipForgetOnDestroy`)
 *
 * This resource is particularly useful for:
 *   * Managing static IP assignments
 *   * Implementing access control
 *   * Setting up local DNS records
 *   * Organizing devices into user groups
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as unifi from "@pulumiverse/unifi";
 *
 * const test = new unifi.iam.User("test", {
 *     mac: "01:23:45:67:89:AB",
 *     name: "some client",
 *     note: "my note",
 *     fixedIp: "10.0.0.50",
 *     networkId: myVlan.id,
 * });
 * ```
