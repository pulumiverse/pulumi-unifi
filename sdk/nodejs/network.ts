/**
 * The `unifi.Network` resource manages networks in your UniFi environment, including WAN, LAN, and VLAN networks. This resource enables you to:
 *
 * * Create and manage different types of networks (corporate, guest, WAN, VLAN-only)
 * * Configure network addressing and DHCP settings
 * * Set up IPv6 networking features
 * * Manage DHCP relay and DNS settings
 * * Configure network groups and VLANs
 *
 * Common use cases include:
 * * Setting up corporate and guest networks with different security policies
 * * Configuring WAN connectivity with various authentication methods
 * * Creating VLANs for network segmentation
 * * Managing DHCP and DNS services for network clients
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as unifi from "@pulumiverse/unifi";
 *
 * const config = new pulumi.Config();
 * const vlanId = config.getNumber("vlanId") || 10;
 * const vlan = new unifi.Network("vlan", {
 *     name: "wifi-vlan",
 *     purpose: "corporate",
 *     subnet: "10.0.0.1/24",
 *     vlanId: vlanId,
 *     dhcpStart: "10.0.0.6",
 *     dhcpStop: "10.0.0.254",
 *     dhcpEnabled: true,
 * });
 * const wan = new unifi.Network("wan", {
 *     name: "wan",
 *     purpose: "wan",
 *     wanNetworkgroup: "WAN",
 *     wanType: "pppoe",
 *     wanIp: "192.168.1.1",
 *     wanEgressQos: 1,
 *     wanUsername: "username",
 *     xWanPassword: "password",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * import from provider configured site
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import unifi:index/network:Network mynetwork 5dc28e5e9106d105bdc87217
 * ```
 *
 * import from another site
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import unifi:index/network:Network mynetwork bfa2l6i7:5dc28e5e9106d105bdc87217

 *
 * import network by name
